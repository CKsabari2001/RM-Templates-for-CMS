# CMS Theme Slider Templates and Service Page

The CMS Theme Slider Templates and Service Page repository contains the source files for slider templates and the service page used in the theme for the CMS (Website Builder) at Refresh Marketing Inc. As a Junior Web Developer (Internship), we created these templates to enhance the functionality and visual appeal of the CMS websites. The repository includes three different types of sliders:

- Thumbnail Slider: A slider with thumbnails at the bottom for navigation.
- Testimonial Slider: A slider for showcasing customer testimonials.
- Carousel Slider: A standard carousel slider for showcasing content.

Additionally, we developed a service page template as part of one of the themes for the CMS Website Builder.These templates are created using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript, providing flexibility and customization options for website development within the CMS environment.
